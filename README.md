HELLO

To run this program input 'python main.py' in your console.

Somethings to keep in mind:
    (1) Download chromedriver : 
        (a) Download chromedriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
        (b) Download chrome from https://www.google.com/chrome/downloads/

            version
    (2) Input path to chromedriver executable in the .env file

        installs the required packages to run the program
    (4) When scraping a batch of tiktok urls make sure that the google

Thank you and happy scraping!
